# Finite Differences Method
An Implementation of the Finite Differences Method for some Two-Dimensional Problems

## Cooling Fin Problem
The  transport  or  advection-diffusion-reaction equation  is  a  well-known  partial  differential  equation employed  to  model  severaltypes  of  flux  problems.  The cooling   fin  problem  is  a  particular  case  of  such  an equation. This work presents a straightforward model for the  rectangular  cooling  fin  in  a  problem.  The  model  was based  on  the  finite  differences  numerical  method  and  an efficient  implementation  was  developed  in  a  high-level mathematical programming language.  The accuracy  was evaluated with different granularity levels of meshes, and two  distinct  boundary  conditions  are  compared.  In  the first one, only prescribed temperatures are assumed at the four  tips  of  the  domain.  For  the  second  scenario,  it  is assumed  a  heat  flux  at  one  tip  of  a  fin  with  the  same geometrical  shape.  The  achieved  solutions  produced  by the  algorithm  were  able  to  depict  the  temperature  along the   whole   fin   surface   accurately.   Furthermore,   the algorithm reaches relevant performance for meshes up to 4257 points where the CPU time was about 33 seconds
